```
-> record the change in the file

## **Part 2: Working with Repositories**

### **Task 7: Branching and Merging**
1. Create a new branch for a feature:
```
git branch feature-login
git checkout feature-login
```
-> Create a branch 

Or use:
```
git checkout -b feature-login
```
2. Add a new file and commit changes:

```
echo "Login Page" > login.html
git add login.html
git commit -m "Added login page"
```
-> add a file and staging to commit and record the changes

3. Merge the feature branch into main:

```
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```
-> merge branch into the main branch

### **Task 8: Handling Merge Conflicts**
1. Create two branches:
```
git branch branch-A
git branch branch-B
```
-> create a branch 

2. Modify the same line in README.md in both branches.

3. Merge branch-A into main:
```
git checkout main
git merge branch-A
```
-> merge into the main branch

4. Attempt to merge branch-B into main (this will cause a conflict):
```
git merge branch-B
```
-> merge the branch into main branch

5. Resolve the conflict manually in README.md, then:
```
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between branch-A and branch-B"
```
-> add file to the staging area and record the changes

### **Task 9: Renaming and Deleting Branches**

1. Rename a branch:
```
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```
-> rename the branch

2. Delete a branch:
```
git branch -d feature-login
```
-> delete the branch
