## Task List: Focused on Repository Management, Commits, Branching, and Merging
## Part 1: Creating and Cloning Repositories
### Task 1: Create a Local Git Repository
1. Create a new project folder:
```
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
```
- create a folder and navigate into the folder

2. Initialize it as a Git repository:
```
git init
```
Explanation: This creates a .git folder that stores the repository's metadata and history.
- initialize git into a local stystum

3. Verify the repository status:
```
git status
```
- display all the track or untack files or folder
- Example Output:
```
On branch main
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```
###  Task 2: Clone a Remote Repository
1. Clone a GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
- clone the existing repository into local
- Explanation: This command downloads the repository to your local system.

3. Verify the cloned repository structure:
```
cd repo
ls -a
```
- nagiate into the cloned repostiory and list all the items
- Output: The .git folder should be present.

## Part 2: Understanding Commits and Commit Messages
###  Task 3: Commit Changes Locally
1. Create a new file and add content:
```
echo "Welcome to Git" > README.md
```
- create a new file with a specific message

2. Stage the file:
```
git add README.md
```
- add a file for staging area  to commit it
- Explanation: git add moves changes to the staging area.

3. Commit the staged file:
```
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added README.md"
```
- Explanation: Commits save the current state of the repository with a message describing the change.

### Task 4: Write Effective Commit Messages
1. Create a detailed commit message:
```
git commit -m "Added initial version of README.md with project overview"
```
- commit the file with a specific message for record the changes 
- Explanation: Commit messages should follow conventions such as starting with a capital letter, being concise, and using the imperative mood.

2. Commit multiple files with one message:
```
touch file1.txt file2.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Added two new files for feature setup"
```
- create a two files and add them to staging area for commit and then commit them with one specific message 
---
## Part 3: Viewing Commit History with git log
### Task 5: View Detailed Commit History
1. View full commit logs:
```
git log
```
- Explanation: Shows a detailed list of commits with hash, author, date, and message.

2. View commit history in a compact format
```
git log --oneline
```
- Example output:
``` 
e23d8a7 Added initial version of README.md
f7b3c62 Initial commit: Added README.md
```
### Task 6: Customize Log Outputs
1. View logs with a graphical representation
```
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```
2. Filter logs for a specific file:
```
git log README.md
```

### **Part 4: Understanding Branching and Merging**
### Task 7: Understanding Branching
1. List all branches:
```
git branch
```
- Explanation: Displays the current branch and all other branches.

2. Create a new branch:
```
git branch feature-branch
```
- Explanation: Creates a new branch without switching to it

3. Switch to the new branch:
```
git checkout feature-branch
```
- alternative command:
```
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
- Explanation: Creates and switches to the branch in one command.

---
## **Part 5: Creating and Working with Branches**
### Task 8: Make Changes in a Branch
1. Add content to a file in the new branch:
```
echo "Feature in progress" > feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Added feature.txt in feature-branch"
```
- create a new file and add file to staging area to commit it and commit it to record the changes

### Task 9: Merging Branches
1. Switch back to the main branch:
```
git checkout main
```
- switch back to main branch

2. Merge the feature-branch into main:
```
git merge feature-branch
```
- merge branch into main branch
---
### **Part 6: Resolving Merge Conflicts**
### Task 10: Simulate a Merge Conflict
1. Modify the same line in a file on two branches:
```
echo "Main branch content" > conflict.txt
git add conflict.txt
git commit -m "Added conflict.txt in main branch"
```
- create a new file and add a file into staging area and commit for record the change 

2. Switch to the other branch and make conflicting changes:
```
git checkout feature-branch
echo "Feature branch content" > conflict.txt
git add conflict.txt
git commit -m "Modified conflict.txt in feature-branch"
```
- switch to another branch
- create a file o  their switched branch and add and commit the file 

3. Merge feature-branch into main:
```
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```
- switch back into the main branch 
- merge this two branch

4. Resolve the conflict by editing the file and choosing the correct version:
- Open conflict.txt and decide which changes to keep.
- Stage the resolved file:
```
git add conflict.txt
```
- Commit the merge:
```
git commit -m "Resolved conflict in conflict.txt"
```
---
### **Part 7: Deleting and Renaming Branches**
### Task 11: Delete a Branch
1. Delete a local branch:
```
git branch -d feature-branch
```
- delete a branch 
- Explanation: This deletes the branch only if it has been fully merged.

2. Force-delete a branch:
```
git branch -D feature-branch
```
- Explanation: Deletes the branch even if it hasnâ€™t been merged.

### Task 12: Rename a Branch
1. Rename the current branch:
```
git branch -m new-branch-name
```
- rename the branch 

2. Rename another branch (not checked out)
```
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```
